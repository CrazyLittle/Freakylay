# Freakylay
An alternative and customizable overlay for [DataPuller Mod](https://github.com/kOFReadie/DataPuller) which lets you choose your own style.

It's still in WIP so working link will comming soon! Stay tuned!

## Features

- change background and font color like you want, even with transparency
- supports long and short names for modifiers (Instant Fail / IF)
- in practice mode, the offset gets displayed instead of the whole percentage
    - 130% => +30%
    - 80% => -20%
- displays accuracy, player health and time in a nice circular progressbar
- it hides itself when in menus
- test it with a preview image of Beat Saber without having the game to run

## How do I customize it?

**Just double-click somewhere on the page!**
